# Latency
* Speed at which the data can travel through the network
* measured in milliseconds or seconds
* low latency = fast connect
* low latency wont be laggy 
* This isnt speed that the data runs at, this is the speed the data connects at.
* Think about like this, how long will it take for the data to run from here to brazil? thats the latency. 

# Bitrate
* number of bits moved or processed in a unit of time
* 100 mbps is a relatively fast network
* this is what you are gonna see from a speed test. 

# bandwidth
* how much data can be sent
* measured in bitrate
* not time
* Think about like this: if you had a small metal pipe, and you wanted to push an entire cheeseburger through, you couldnt. the pipe is too small. You could at best shove a couple fries through there. There is a limit to how big of a thing you can push through this pipe, and there is a limit to how much data can be pushed through your connection at once. 

# Latency vs bandwidth 
* bandwidth is capacity possible amount of data
* Latency is how fast you can connect to a website, not how fast it loads.
