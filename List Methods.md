my_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
my_list.count(2) # returns 2 
counts how many of them there are not an index position 
my_list.append(my_list) 
appends a full list instead of adding it together which is a problem
my_list.extend(my_list)
does what you think it would and works good 
my_list.sort() 
based on ascii table lowest to highest
my_list.reverse()
flips the positions 
0 = -1 
1 = -2 
2 = -3 
etc
