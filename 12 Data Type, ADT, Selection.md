# Data types
* Kinds of data something is ( Text, Number, string, list etc )
* type(fruits) = list type("apple") = string 
* usually used to describe a variable ( "this variable is a string" )
* "primitive" data types are built into language ( e.g. int string float ) ( you can make your own data types !! )

# ADT
* Abstract data type
* Custom data type you create
* you create them to help your program work better 

# Selection
* Uses a boolean ( True / False ) condition to choose a path your program goes down 
* This is just an if statement 

```py
x = 2
if x == 1:
    print("Its one")
elif x < 1:
    print("it is NOT one.")
elif x == 2:
    print("Two!!")
elif x > 2:
    print("bigger than two")
```
* ^ all of that is selection ( in python ) ( i am not putting snap screenshots in my notes i hate snap with all of my soul )
