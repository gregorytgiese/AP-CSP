# Linear search
* Simple search one by one
* Start with first element and then go to second element etc
* Example:
    * Looking through list of real numbers to count how many 7s there are

# Binary search 
* Divide and conquer search
* More efficient or faster than linear search
* List must be sorted
    * Why?
        * Cuts list in half every time to find a value
        * that doesnt help if the list isnt sorted
* Example:
    * Guessing number game


# Append
* adds something to end of list
