# Element #definition
* A data value in a list or array
* Apple could be an element of a list called "fruits"

# List 
* Group of items
* Example:
    * Fruits = ["Apples", "bananas", "tangerines"] 

# Index 
* The position of an element in a list or array
* Apple is the 3rd item in the list "fruits", so it's index position is 3 ( index position is 2 in python, as python lists start at 0)

# Array
* Data structure consisting of collections of elements ( values, variables) 
* each item has an index
* Similar to a list but slightly different, can do different things with them
        ^ I still dont really know why they are different. In python, what i have been calling an array, i watched as someone refer to it as a list. I have no clue.
