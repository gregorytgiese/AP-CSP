# The big 5
* You must have all five of these things for the create task
* these are legit helpful and i know early in the year it doesnt seem like it
* but they are and you keep looking back at this so save this somewhere

1. You must have atleast one list

2. You must have a procedure with atleast one parameter

Inside of that procedure :
    3. You must have a loop
    4. You must have have sequencing ( explained below )
    5. You must have selection

# Sequencing
* Just the idea that you have to put code in a logical order
* mostly they just want you to be able to explain that you couldnt put the code in a different order
* example:
```py
x = 2
if x == 1:
    print("Its one")
elif x < 2:
    print("it is NOT one.")
elif x < 3:
    print(" less than three!!")
elif x < 4:
    print("less than 4 ")
```
* ^ this makes sense, ( in order) ( the code is nonsensical )
```py
x = 2
if x == 1:
    print("Its one")
elif x < 4:
    print("less than 4")
elif x < 3:
    print("less than 3!!")
elif x > 2:
    print("it is not one")
```
* ^ this does not ( it will always print less than 4 if it isnt 1 and it isnt greater than 4. it is never gonna get to any of those other elifs. )
